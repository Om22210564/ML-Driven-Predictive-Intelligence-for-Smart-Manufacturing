### 🏭 Smart Manufacturing Analytics & Digital Twin Simulation

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes machine-level manufacturing data to:

Discover hidden operational states using unsupervised learning

Engineer industry-valid performance labels

Predict efficiency scores using ML models

Build a Digital Twin to simulate and evaluate optimization strategies

The goal is not just prediction, but decision support for smart manufacturing systems.

📦 Key Modules

EDA & Regime Analysis – Understand efficiency, errors, downtime

Operational Clustering – Identify hidden production states

Label Engineering – Rule-based, industry-valid performance labels

Efficiency Prediction – Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear models

Digital Twin Simulation – Test vibration, power, and flow changes

🧠 Key Insight

Efficiency optimization is constraint-driven:
reducing vibration improves output, while reducing power can reduce efficiency.
